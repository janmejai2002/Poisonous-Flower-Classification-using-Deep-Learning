# Poisonous Flower Classification using Deep Learning
A deep learning model to classify the image of a flower into one of the five categories : Calotropis, Cascabela, Datura, Hemlock, Nerium.
There are various types of poisonous plants which exist in nature and biologists or even common people can classify them using certain characteristics such as smell, stem color, the flowers they bloom etc. 

If a person unknowingly comes in contact of a poisonous flower or mistakenly consumes it, their treatment becomes much easier if the type of flower was known.

The aim of this project is to use Deep Learning to classify the image of a flower of a poisonous plant into one of the following categories:

1.  [__Calotropis__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calotropis_gigantea#:~:text=Calotropis%20is%20a%20poisonous%20plant.&text=It%20is%20used%20as%20an,keratoconjunctivitis%20and%20reversible%20vision%20loss.)

2.  [__Cascabela Thevetia__](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/poisonous-plant-yellow-oleander-cascabela-thevetia/#:~:text=Cascabela%20thevetia%20is%20a%20restricted,particularly%20the%20fruit%20and%20seeds.&text=Symptoms%20may%20include%20a%20burning,a%20slow%20or%20irregular%20heartbeat.)

3. [__Datura__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura#:~:text=All%20species%20of%20Datura%20are,even%20death%20if%20taken%20internally.)

4. [__Hemlock or Conium maculatum__]

5. [__Nerium oleander__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerium#Toxicity)

While these flowers look really beautiful, they are certainly nasty if mistakenly consumed.
